# LeetCode | Nov. 2022 - Present
>Currently not working on LeetCode right now.
LeetCode solutions by an aspiring self-taught software engineer, for practicing more complex problems.

**Please do not use these solutions for academic purposes, I am not held accountable
for any academic use of these solutions.** 

(I'm really not trying to get 
anyone in trouble.)

Solutions should be posted daily, and will be written primarily in Java and Python.

Long-term goals with this repository would be completing all Easy, Medium, and Hard problems
on LeetCode and gaining experience with more complex algorithms and more complex tasks.

Some solutions will have comments placed within them for a description of code that may be slightly complex at a first glance.
